This is the source code for a cloud-based application in Azure Microsoft that provides image processing tools to users. The application allows users to sign up using their email address and set a password. After logging in, users can upload an image from their device and choose a tool from a drop-down menu. For example, they can choose to blur the image, and the blurred image will be displayed and available for download. Another tool is text extraction from the image, where the extracted text will be displayed to the user as well. 

All the source code, including the backend side of the web app ([app.py](app.py)) and templates, are included in this. Additionally, [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) is added to include libraries and modules that were used in the app, such as Flask and image processing libraries.
